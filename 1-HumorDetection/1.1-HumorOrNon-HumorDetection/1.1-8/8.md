#### Abstract

Humor is an essential but most fascinating element in personal communication. How to build computational models to discover the structures of humor, recognize humor and even generate humor remains a challenge and there have been yet few attempts on it. In this paper, we construct and collect four datasets with distinct joke types in both English and Chinese and conduct learning experiments on humor recognition. We implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with extensive filter size, number and Highway Networks to increase the depth of networks. Results show that our model outperforms in recognition of different types of humor with benchmarks collected in both English and Chinese languages on accuracy, precision, and recall in comparison to previous works.

### Introduction
In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with augmentation of both the filter sizes and filter numbers. We use the architecture called highway network to implement a much more proficient model for humor recognition. The performance on many benchmarks shows a significant improvement in detecting different humor context genre.

### Related Work
In a recent work, Chen and Lee predicted audience’s laughter also using convolutional neural network. Their work gets higher detection accuracy and is able to learn essential feature automatically (Chen and Lee, 2017). However, there are still some limitations: (a) they focused on only a specific humor type in TED data, that is puns. (b) the datasets in most studies are English corpus. (c) the evaluations are isolated from other research.

In our work, we build the humor recognizer by using CNNs with extensive filter size and number, and the result shows higher accuracy from previous CNNs models. We conducted experiments on two different dataset, which were used in the previous studies. One is Pun of the Day (Yang et al., 2015), and the other is 16000 One-Liners (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005). In addition, we constructed a Chinese dataset to evaluate the generality of the method performance on humor recognition against different languages.
